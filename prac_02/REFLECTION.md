# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Current goal is getting the majority of lectures finished on Sundays before the seminar, completed at home at my desk.
No duration set for this currently, as time and my availability changes. Will always be completed before the seminar.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Finishing lectures in time, completing the pracs a few days before they are due. Attempting all extra material. 
Criticising my work and asking myself is there a better/more efficient option?

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Set a specific time period to work through my lectures and pracs, so I don't accidentally spend too long on them. 
Also want to attempt more tasks given in lectures on my own in full before continuing. I am too quick to give up when 
I hit a wall.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Struggling to work through the entire practical in the allocated time. This may be due to having many distractions
like my friends around me. Will try to focus more, so I am able to ask questions when I come across problems. 
Another way to help with my focus will be to read through the prac and attempt some items before the timeslot. 

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Working through all items, criticising my work, attempting extra questions. Focusing on what I've learnt during the week
and how I can apply that to my work.
